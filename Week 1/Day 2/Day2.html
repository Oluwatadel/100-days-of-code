        </legend>
        <p>Elements are designators that define the structure and content of objects within a page. Some of the more frequently used elements include:
            <ul>
                <h4>Multiple levels of headings, identified as</h4>
                <li><strong>&lth1></strong> through <strong>&lth6></strong> elements</li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <h4>Paragraphs,identified as the</h4>
                <li>&ltp> element&lt/p></li>
            </ul>
        <p>Elements are identified by the use of less-than and greater-than angle brackets, < >, surrounding the element name.   </p>

            <h1>HTML Attributes</h1>
        </legend>
        <p>Attributes are properties used to provide additional information about an element. The most common attributes include the id attribute, which identifies an element; the class attribute, which classifies an element; the src attribute, which specifies a source for embeddable content; and the href attribute, which provides a hyperlink reference to a linked resource.

            Attributes are defined within the opening tag, after an element&#39s name. Generally attributes include a name and a value. The format for these attributes consists of the attribute name followed by an equals sign and then a quoted attribute value. For example, an <a> element including an href attribute would look like the following:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>src</strong> in &ltimg src="source of image"></span></li>
            <li><strong>href</strong> in &lta href="#"></li>
        </ul>

        <p>According to Mozilla.org, CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) allows you to create great-looking web pages, but how does it work under the hood? This article explains what CSS is with a simple syntax example and also covers some key terms about the language.</p>
        <h1>What is CSS for</h1>
        <p>As we have mentioned before, CSS is a language for specifying how documents are presented to users — how they are styled, laid out, etc.

            A document is usually a text file structured using a markup language — HTML is the most common markup language, but you may also come across other markup languages such as SVG or XML.</p>
